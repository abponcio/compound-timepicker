compound-timepicker
============

Compound is composed of two or more separate elements and `compound-timepicker` happens to be under this category.

`compound-timepicker` is a timepicker. It is used to select a single time (hours: minutes) on both mobile and desktop web applications.
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of each clock hand.

Example:

    <compound-timepicker></compound-timepicker>
    <compound-timepicker hours="23"></compound-timepicker>
    <compound-timepicker minutes="59"></compound-timepicker>
    <compound-timepicker step="5"></compound-timepicker>
    <compound-timepicker time-format="24"></compound-timepicker>

On mobile, pickers are best suited for display in a confirmation dialog. The timepicker can be wrapped inside a `paper-dialog`. `compound-timepicker-dialog` is created alongside `compound-timepicker` to provide a easy-to-use dialog timepicker.

Example:

    <compound-timepicker-dialog></compound-timepicker-dialog>
    <compound-timepicker-dialog hours="23"></compound-timepicker-dialog>
    <compound-timepicker-dialog minutes="59"></compound-timepicker-dialog>
    <compound-timepicker-dialog step="5"></compound-timepicker-dialog>
    <compound-timepicker-dialog time-format="24"></compound-timepicker-dialog>
